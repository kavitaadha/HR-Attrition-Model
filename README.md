# Workforce Retention Analytics - Interactive Streamlit App
🚀 Live App: https://capstoneuscb.streamlit.app

## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end workforce analytics capstone designed to help leaders understand **why attrition happens**, how workforce stability varies across teams and segments, and what actions can improve retention.  
The work combines **analytics + strategy**: exploratory analysis and modeling to surface drivers, segmentation to identify actionable workforce groups, and an interactive Streamlit application that makes insights usable for non-technical stakeholders.

## Business Problem
Workforce instability creates hidden operational cost: frequent backfilling, inconsistent productivity, onboarding burden, and management time spent reacting instead of planning.  
Most organizations have HR data, but struggle to convert it into:
- clear drivers of attrition,
- practical segments for targeted interventions, and
- an executive-friendly tool that supports consistent decisions.

---

## Objective
- Identify key drivers and patterns associated with attrition and workforce instability  
- Compare workforce trends across roles, tenure bands, and employee segments  
- Create an interactive application that enables stakeholders to explore insights and support retention planning  
- Translate analysis into a structured set of strategy-ready recommendations (not just charts)

---

## Approach
**1) Data preparation**
- Cleaned and standardized workforce datasets
- Engineered analysis-ready features for retention and workforce trend analysis

**2) Exploratory analysis**
- Assessed workforce composition and attrition patterns
- Compared patterns across meaningful workforce cuts (role groups, tenure, and segment indicators)

**3) Segmentation**
- Grouped employees into interpretable segments to support targeted retention actions
- Used clustering to move from “one-size-fits-all” solutions to segment-based interventions

**4) Modeling**
- Built models to highlight the strongest factors associated with attrition risk
- Focused on interpretability so results can inform business decisions

**5) Productization (Streamlit App)**
- Built an interactive Streamlit application to make insights accessible:
  - filters and drill-downs for stakeholder exploration,
  - dashboards for trends and segment views,
  - outputs designed for leadership conversations and planning.

## Key Outcomes (What this project delivered)
- A clear workforce retention analytics framework: **drivers → segments → actions**
- A stakeholder-ready Streamlit app that improves accessibility and speeds up decision-making
- Executive-ready deliverables that translate analysis into strategy and operational next steps
- A reusable structure that can be applied to other HR/workforce datasets and retention problems
